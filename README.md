##Description
Classification and Regression, from linear and logistic regression to neural
networks

##Source structure
- `src/ffnn.py`: Class containing the feed forward neural networks
- `src/logistic_reg.py`: Class containing the logistic regression functions
- `src/utils.py`: Utillity functions like activation functions and such
- `src/logeg_predict.py`: Performing logistic regression on the Wisconsin breast
cancer dataset. To run the functions, scroll down to the bottom of the script
and remove the hashtag in front of function to run.
- `src/franke.py`: Script containing Frank's function. Is used to produce the
dataset in the regression case.
- `src/sgd_predict.py`: Performing regression on Franke's dataset by using the
SGD method in OLS and Ridge.
-  `src/franke_results/franke_predict.py`: Performing regression on Franke´s
dataset by using the neural network.
-  `src/mnist_results/mnist_predict.py`: Performing classification on the MNIST
dataset by using the neural network.

-  `doc/main.tex`: The report as a tex file
-  `doc/references.bib`: References as a bib file
-  `doc/main.pdf`: The report as a pdf file
-  `doc/assets`: A folder with all the figures

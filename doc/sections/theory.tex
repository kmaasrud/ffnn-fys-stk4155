\subsection{Datasets}
We will analyze the following datasets:
\subsubsection{MNIST}
The famous MNIST dataset is a collection of handwritten numbers, as $28\times 28$ grayscale images. It comes in two sets, a training set with $60,000$ images, and a testing set with $10,000$ images. In this report, we will model the inputs as a $28\times 28 = 784$-dimensional vector, and the output as a $10$-dimensional state vector, with each dimension representing the corresponding digit.

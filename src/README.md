# Source code

The Feed Forward Neural Network class is named FFNN and is defined in [`ffnn.py`](https://github.com/kmaasrud/ffnn-fys-stk4155/blob/main/src/ffnn.py).

General functions that have no direct relation to a class or can be easily detached from a specific problem should be located in the [`utils.py`](https://github.com/kmaasrud/ffnn-fys-stk4155/blob/main/src/utils.py) file. This is to ensure reusability and force a generalized coding style on our codebase.
